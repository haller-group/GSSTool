function [ r, drdqdd,drdqd,drdq, c0] = residual_nonlinear_uf( q, qd, qdd, t, M,K,C,Fnl)
%  RESIDUAL_NONLINEAR In the following function, we construct the residual needed for time integration 
% of
% 
% second-order system
% 
% $\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}} + \mathbf{C}\dot{\mathbf{q}} + \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{q}) 
% =\mathbf{F}_{ext}(t)$,
% 
% where we use the residual is defined as
% 
% $\mathbf{r}(\ddot{\mathbf{q}},\dot{\mathbf{q}},\mathbf{q}) = \mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}} 
% + \mathbf{C}\dot{\mathbf{q}} + \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{q}) - \mathbf{F}_{ext}(t)$.
% 
% A generic Residual function, whose _handle_ is passed for performing Implicit 
% Newmark and Generalized- $$\alpha$$  nonlinear time integration schemes in this 
% code has the following syntax:
% 
% $$\texttt{[r, drdqdd, drdqd, drdq, c0] = Residual(q,qd,qdd,t);}$$
% 
% where
% 
% $$\texttt{r} = \mathbf{r},\\\texttt{drdqdd} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\ddot{\mathbf{q}}},\\\texttt{drdqd} 
% = \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\dot{\mathbf{q}}},\\\texttt{drdq}= \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial\mathbf{q}},\\\texttt{c0} 
% = \textrm{a scalar measure for comparing the residual norm while checking for 
% convergence}$$
% 
% The extra arguments:
%% 
% # $\texttt{Assembly}$, which is an instance of Assembly class
% # $\texttt{Fext}$, which is a function handle for the external forcing,
%% 
% are required for computing the residual in this case.
% 
% New residual functions that follow the above-mentioned syntax can be written 
% according to user preference. This way, the same time integration class can 
% be used to solve a variety of problems.
% 
% Please refer to the Mechanical directory in the examples folder to understand 
% applications and usage.
%% 
% In this function, it is assumed that the matrices $\mathbf{M,C}$ for the finite 
% element mesh were precomputed and stored in the $\texttt{DATA}$ property of 
% the $\texttt{Assembly}$ object to avoid unnecessary assembly during each time-step.
%% 
% The tangent stiffness $\mathbf{K} = \frac{\partial\mathbf{F}}{\partial\mathbf{q}}$ 
% and the the internal force $\mathbf{F}$, however, need to be assmbled at each 
% iteration depending on the current state. To perform this assembly, we first 
% need the constrained vector of displacements $\mathbf{q}$ to be converted to 
% its counterpart $\mathbf{u}$ that contains all the degrees of freedom. 
%% 
% These matrices and the external forcing vector are appropriately constrained 
% according to the boundary conditions:
qw = [q;qd];
F_nonlinear = Fnl(qw);

%% 
% Residual is computed according to the formula above:
F_inertial = M * qdd;
F_damping = C * qd;
F_stiff = K * q;
r = F_inertial + F_damping +F_stiff +F_nonlinear ;%+ F_external ;
drdqdd = M;
drdqd = C;
drdq = K;
%% 
% We use the following measure to comapre the norm of the residual $\mathbf{r}$
% 
% $$\texttt{c0} = \|\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{q}}\| + \|\mathbf{C}\dot{\mathbf{q}}\| 
% + \|\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{q})\| + \|\mathbf{F}_{ext}(t)\|$$
c0 = norm(F_inertial) + norm(F_damping) + norm(F_stiff) + norm(F_nonlinear) ;%+ norm(F_external);
